# Tego

Tego is a personal secrets tool aiming to combine the functionality of `kpx`Â with `salpass`, with the one failing falling back to the latter.

## How to use

Run the script with a given secret name:

```bash
./runner.py domain.tld
***** # type password
```

The secret is silently copied into the clipboard.
